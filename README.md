# Credit Card Sales Agent

The neuro-symbolic data interface to customer credit card transactions and (potential) merchant rewards data.
This interface is used by a credit card sales agent that helps customers determine which type of credit card is best suited for them based on the rewards they can earn.

The SQRL script ingests, transforms, and analyzes the data which is then exposed through a semantically
annotated GraphQL API to the agent.
